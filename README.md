Employing the foundational web technologies of HTML5 and CSS, I crafted a website to showcase my portfolio as a student specializing in database administration. This project not only highlighted my journey and achievements in the realm of database management but also underscored my proficiency in modern web development practices. Through the strategic use of HTML5's semantic elements and CSS's styling capabilities, I created a visually appealing and informative online presence that reflects my dual expertise in both database administration and front-end web development.
